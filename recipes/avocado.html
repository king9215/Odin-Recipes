        <h4><em>Description</em></h4>
        <p>Who else loves avocado toast? Because I know for a fact that I do.</p>
        <p>Avocado is one fruit that is very rich in fiber. So if you’re wanting a meal that will fill you up for an entire morning, you should consider this recipe.I honestly love it so much and I eat mine with eggs and a sprinkle of salt and pepper, Because avocado on bread without seasoning does have a bland taste. However, it’s completely optional if choose to eat it with eggs.</p>
