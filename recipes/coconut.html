        <h4><em>Description</em></h4>
        <p>Nigerian Coconut Rice is one of my favorite rice recipes,if you’re wondering if you should buy some coconut to make this recipe, you don’t. Just purchase regular coconut milk from your store, and it would do just fine.</p>
        <p>For my recipe, I decided to add a variety of peppers,However, if spicy food is not your thing, then you can skip it. But in all honesty, the additional peppers do make this recipe taste BOMB (so I suggest giving it a shot).</p>
        <p></p>
